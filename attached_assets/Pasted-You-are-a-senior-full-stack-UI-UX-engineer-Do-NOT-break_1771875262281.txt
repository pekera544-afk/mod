You are a senior full-stack UI/UX engineer. 
Do NOT break existing logic or backend. 
Enhance layout responsiveness, chat system, news module, and real-time notifications.

PART 1 — DESKTOP RESPONSIVE FIX (VERY IMPORTANT)

Problem: On desktop the layout looks too small and centered. It must feel full-width and properly spaced.

Requirements:
1) Implement responsive layout rules:
   - For screens > 1280px:
     - Use max-width: 1600px
     - Use 90–95% width container
     - Add proper spacing between sections
     - Use grid layout with 3-column structure where appropriate
   - For screens > 1600px:
     - Expand to 1800px max width
     - Increase card spacing and scale elements slightly (1.05)
   - Remove narrow centered look.

2) Improve desktop room list layout:
   - Active rooms should display in responsive grid (auto-fit minmax 320px)
   - Featured section should align better with stats.
   - Sidebar should not shrink main content too much.

3) Ensure:
   - Mobile unchanged.
   - Tablet unchanged.
   - Only enhance desktop view.

   - Delete own message
   - Clear chat (owner/admin only)

3) Improve input:
   - Multiline textarea
   - Enter to send, Shift+Enter new line
   - Emoji support
