Create a production-ready, Replit-independent, Node.js-based web application for an 18+ cinema community platform (watch parties + live text chat) called “YOKO AJANS”.

GOALS
- Must run on any Node.js hosting (VPS, Railway, Render, Docker, cPanel Node, etc.). No Replit-specific features.
- Mobile-first UI, fully responsive for mobile / tablet / desktop.
- PWA support (installable), with offline-friendly shell, service worker, and manifest.
- Multilingual: Turkish + English with i18n. Default language on first visit MUST be Turkish. Provide a language switcher and persist preference.
- Admin Panel must allow changing site branding and PWA settings without redeploying.

TECH STACK (Required)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: PostgreSQL preferred (SQLite allowed for local dev), using an ORM (Prisma recommended).
- Auth: JWT-based auth for admin panel; role-based access control (Admin / VIP / User).
- Frontend: React (Vite) or Next.js (choose one and implement cleanly), Tailwind CSS for styling.
- PWA: Workbox or equivalent, proper service worker registration, cache strategy, update flow.

CORE FEATURES
1) PUBLIC / USER APP
- Homepage dashboard with premium dark theme (black #0f0f14, matte gold #d4af37, subtle purple/red cinematic highlights).
- Sections:
  - “Live Cinema Rooms” list (room name, current movie, participant count, trending badge, “Join Room” button)
  - “Tonight’s Featured Screening” card (scheduled watch party)
  - Announcements / Agency updates
  - “Top Members of the Month” leaderboard (top 3)
- Cinema Room Page:
  - Synchronized watch party player placeholder area (do NOT implement piracy; assume user provides legitimate stream URL or embedded provider).
  - Live TEXT chat (no voice chat).
  - Participant list and roles (Admin/VIP/User).
  - Emoji reactions and message moderation (admin delete / timeout).
- Notifications:
  - In-app notifications for new announcements and event reminders.

2) ADMIN PANEL (CRITICAL)
Admin panel must be a separate protected area with a strong dashboard:
- Manage site branding settings (editable from UI):
  - Site title (default: “YOKO AJANS”)
  - Tagline (TR default: “Birlikte İzle, Birlikte Hisset.” / EN default: “Watch Together, Feel Together.”)
  - Logo URL
  - Theme accents (primary accent color, optional background image URL)
- Manage i18n text overrides:
  - Allow admin to override certain UI strings for TR and EN (at least hero title/tagline + menu labels).
- Manage PWA settings from the Admin panel (NO redeploy):
  - App name (manifest.name) and short name
  - Description
  - Theme color and background color
  - App icons (upload or URL for 192x192 and 512x512)
  - Start URL and scope
  - Display mode (standalone)
  - Enable/disable PWA install prompt
  - Force service worker update button (“Publish PWA Update”) that bumps a version field and triggers clients to refresh caches gracefully.
- Manage content:
  - Announcements (CRUD)
  - Events / watch party schedule (CRUD)
  - Cinema Rooms (CRUD): room title, description, poster, allowed roles, max users
  - Users (CRUD): assign role, VIP status, ban/timeout
- Provide an audit log of admin actions.

PWA REQUIREMENTS
- Must generate and serve:
  - /manifest.webmanifest built dynamically from DB-backed settings (admin-editable).
- Service worker:
  - Cache-first for static assets, network-first for API calls (with fallback).
  - Offline “shell” page with last cached announcements list.
  - Update strategy: when a new SW is available, show a toast “Update available” with a refresh button.
- Must pass Lighthouse PWA checks (as much as possible).

INTERNATIONALIZATION
- Use a robust i18n framework (react-i18next or next-intl).
- Turkish is default on first visit.
- Detect language preference from localStorage; if absent, use Turkish.
- Provide a language toggle in header: TR / EN.
- All navigation labels, buttons, and key sections must be translated.
- Allow server-side storage of preferred language per user (optional), but client persistence is required.

DATA MODEL (Minimum)
- Settings table: siteTitle, taglineTR, taglineEN, logoUrl, primaryColor, etc.
- PwaSettings table: name, shortName, descriptionTR/EN, themeColor, backgroundColor, icon192Url, icon512Url, startUrl, scope, display, version, enabled
- Users table: username, email, passwordHash, role, vip, createdAt
- Rooms table: title, movieTitle, posterUrl, isTrending, allowedRoles, createdAt
- Messages table: roomId, userId, content, createdAt, deletedAt
- Announcements table: titleTR/EN, contentTR/EN, createdAt, pinned
- Events table: titleTR/EN, startTime, posterUrl, descriptionTR/EN

API ROUTES (Minimum)
- GET /api/settings
- GET /api/pwa/manifest  (returns manifest JSON based on DB)
- Admin:
  - PUT /api/admin/settings
  - PUT /api/admin/pwa
  - POST/PUT/DELETE announcements, rooms, events
  - POST /api/admin/pwa/publish-update (increments version + returns new version)

DEPLOYMENT
- Provide Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml (Postgres + app).
- Provide .env.example with required variables.
- Provide scripts:
  - npm run dev
  - npm run build
  - npm start
  - prisma migrate deploy / seed
- Must store persistent data in DB, not filesystem, so it works on ephemeral hosts too.

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
- Premium “luxury cinema club” look:
  - Dark glassmorphism cards, soft glow borders, rounded corners, subtle gradients.
  - Clear spacing, readable typography.
- Must include a hamburger menu (mobile) and sidebar (tablet/desktop).
- Must include a floating quick-chat button.
- Accessibility: basic contrast and keyboard nav.

OUTPUT
- Generate the full project structure (backend + frontend).
- Provide all code files needed, not pseudo-code.
- Include seed data that sets default Turkish content and default branding.
- Ensure “YOKO AJANS” is editable from Admin panel and instantly reflects on the public UI without redeploying.
