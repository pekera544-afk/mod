Update ONLY the HOMEPAGE UI to match the attached reference screenshot’s layout, spacing, component hierarchy, and premium neon-glow style. The backend and features are already implemented; do NOT change business logic. Only refactor/replace homepage UI components and styling to visually match the reference.

GOAL
- Make the homepage look extremely close to the reference screenshot:
  - Dark luxury theme
  - Matte gold primary accents
  - Purple neon glow highlights
  - Glassmorphism cards
  - Rounded corners
  - Subtle particles / cosmic background feel
  - Strong hero banner with wolf emblem
  - Stats cards row
  - “Featured members” cards (top 3)
  - “Quick Access” icon cards grid
  - “Active Rooms” list with badges, avatars, counts
  - Announcements section at bottom
- Keep it responsive: mobile first, but also works on tablet/desktop.
- Keep the existing navigation structure and routes; only update the homepage visuals.

TECH/UI REQUIREMENTS
- Use React + Tailwind CSS (or the project’s existing UI stack).
- Use consistent spacing and sizes like the screenshot: large hero banner, medium stat cards, big featured member cards.
- Use a consistent glow system:
  - gold glow for primary CTA and borders
  - purple glow for secondary emphasis and “VIP” feeling
- Use glassmorphism:
  - background blur + semi-transparent dark overlays for cards
- Ensure text is crisp and readable.

HOMEPAGE STRUCTURE (MUST MATCH)

1) TOP APP BAR (sticky)
- Left: hamburger menu icon
- Center/left: brand “YOKO AJANS” with a wolf icon logo
- Right side:
  - VIP pill button (small)
  - notification bell icons with red badges (two bells like screenshot)
  - user avatar with name “REHA” and role “Admin”
- Background: dark with subtle gradient, thin divider line.

2) HERO BANNER (very prominent card)
- Large rounded hero card with:
  - Left side: title “YOKO AJANS” (large), subtitle “Sesin Gücü Bizde!” (script-like emphasis on “Bizde!”)
  - Under title: small stat chips:
    - “145 Aktif Yayıncı”
    - “98,750 ₺ Bu Ayki Kazancı”
    - right aligned: “Şu An 12 Oda Aktif”
  - Right side: big circular wolf emblem image with purple wings/glow behind it
- Add a soft neon border and glow around the hero card.
- Background image/texture: cinematic/cosmic night vibe.

3) STATS ROW (4 cards)
Below hero:
- 4 equal cards with icons and counts:
  - “3570 Toplam Üye”
  - “88 Online”
  - “124 VIP Üye”
  - “6 Aktif Oda”
- Cards are glassy, with subtle glow and icons.

4) FEATURED MEMBERS SECTION (“Ajansta Öne Çıkanlar”)
- Header row:
  - Title left: “Ajansta Öne Çıkanlar”
  - Right: “Tümü” button (small rounded)
- Three large member cards in a row (or horizontal scroll on mobile if needed):
  - Card 1 (gold glow + crown): “FIRARİ” @firari (rank 1)
  - Card 2 (purple glow + crown): “NAZO” @nazo (rank 2)
  - Card 3 (gold/purple mix): “REHA” @admin (rank 3)
- Each card has:
  - circular avatar
  - crown badge
  - neon audio-wave-like background texture behind avatar
  - strong colored border glow (gold for #1, purple for #2)
- Typography and layout should match the reference: big name text, small handle.

5) QUICK ACCESS SECTION (“Hızlı Erişim”)
- Title: “Hızlı Erişim”
- 5 small square/rect cards with icons and labels:
  - “PK / Etkinlikler”
  - “Sohbet”
  - “Film & Sinema”
  - “VIP”
  - “Uygulamalar”
- Each card has a neon icon and a subtle glow.
- Use a grid that wraps nicely on mobile.

6) ACTIVE ROOMS SECTION (“Aktif Odalar”)
- Header row:
  - Title: “Aktif Odalar”
  - Right: “Oda Kur” button (small rounded) with a plus icon; button should glow purple/gold.
- Room list items (stacked):
  - Each room item is a long glass card with:
    - left: small icon + room name
    - center: participant count (e.g., 45, 32, 23) with user icon
    - right: small circular participant avatars
    - badges like “Trend” (pill with flame icon) where applicable
- Example room names like screenshot:
  - “Eğlence & Sohbet”
  - “Radyo | Müzik | Muhabbet”
  - “Sari Kizlarin Yeri”
- Keep the floating chat button bottom-right: large gold circular button with chat icon and glow.

7) ANNOUNCEMENTS SECTION (“Duyurular”)
- Header:
  - “Duyurular”
  - right: “Tümünü Gör”
- Announcement card with icon and title (like “Kazanç Dağıtımı Yapıldı!”)
- Same glass + glow style, rounded corners.

VISUAL DETAILS
- Background: dark gradient + subtle particles, not plain black.
- Borders: 1px subtle, plus outer glow.
- Shadows: soft and premium; no harsh drop shadows.
- Use consistent border radius (e.g., 18–24px).
- Hover states for desktop: slightly brighter glow and slight lift.
- Motion: subtle (optional) — gentle pulse on badges and CTA buttons, but do not overdo.

DO NOT CHANGE
- Do not remove existing routes, data fetching, socket logic, or auth.
- Only update the homepage UI layer and styling.
- Keep i18n keys if the project uses translations; for now Turkish text is fine as shown.

DELIVERABLES
- Update the homepage component(s) and related CSS/Tailwind classes.
- If needed, add a small reusable GlowCard component.
- Ensure mobile looks like the screenshot first, then adapt for larger screens.
- Provide the final code changes and confirm the homepage now matches the reference layout closely.
